**Work In Progress**

Lightning is a lightning-fast file search for systemd based linux systems. Currently, there is a prototype I've built in python that paired with the [typesense dashboard]([url](https://github.com/bfritscher/typesense-dashboard)https://github.com/bfritscher/typesense-dashboard), searches are over 900x faster than the default file system search. I am currently working on a proper GUI using Tauri and React, as well as faster indexing and reindexing logic in Rust. Star the repo and stay tuned!
